## Rules
Each player has a 3x3 grid, organized into three columns. They take turns rolling a die and placing it into an open spot in their grid. If there is a matching die in their opponent's matching column, the opponent must remove all matching dice in that column. When one player's grid is full, the game is over and the player with the highest score is the winner.
## Scoring
Each column is calculated separately, then added to the player's total score. If there are matching dice in the column, their values are added together and multiplied by the amount of matching dice.
## Credits
This is a PICO-8 adaptation of the dice mini-game Knucklebones from _Cult of the Lamb_. I wanted to keep playing it on my Miyoo Mini so I took the opportunity to learn a little about game dev and the PICO-8. This is the first time I've made a game and I really enjoyed the process. I hope you enjoy it too! All the coding and art is by me.
